# Brainfuck-Interpreter
This is a simple brainfuck interpreter I wrote in C and took about 1 hour to make

You can find the instructions in the op-code.txt file

# How to compile the interpreter
1. Go into the bfc directory
2. Type make
3. Now you can use Brain Fuck!
(Optional) 4. Move the exe to '/usr/local/bin/'(i use mac which this will work on linux for windows you can google where to move it)
(Optional) Whatyou just did there made it so you can just type 'brainfuck' in your terminal(cmd for windows) without making a copy of the executable

# How to use the interpreter
1. Make a brainfuck program with the '.bf' file extension
2. Run the interpreter like this 'brainfuck your-program-name-here.bf'
3. Have fun
